# 🕹️ Top-Down Pixel Art Game

A simple top-down 2D pixel art game built in Python — created as a hands-on way to learn game development and Python programming.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Learn Python through practical, fun development
- Build a small playable game from scratch
- Explore game loops, sprite handling, input, and collision detection
- Work with pixel art graphics in a top-down 2D style

## 🎯 Project Structure
- `pyke_pyxel`: a semi-reusable, highly primitive game engine on top of Pyxel
- `rpg`: skeleton for a room-based RPG
- `pixi-common`: the beginnings of a type of tower defence game

---

## 🧩 TODO

- Cache TileMap image in draw.tile_map to avoid nested looping

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **ChatGPT Python by Nicholas Barker** - to teach me Python and it's tooling in VSCode
- **Python 3.x**
- **[Pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel)** — retro game engine for Python
- VSCode for development
